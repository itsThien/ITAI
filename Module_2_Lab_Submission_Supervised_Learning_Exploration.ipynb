        "1. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
        "   - I found 15 missing values in the 'age' column. I chose to impute these with the median age, as the distribution was slightly skewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:\n",
        "   - The 'color' feature was categorical. I used one-hot encoding to convert it into binary columns, resulting in 'color_red', 'color_blue', and 'color_green'.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
        "   - I applied StandardScaler to all numerical features to ensure they were on the same scale, which is particularly important for distance-based algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Feature Selection/Engineering**:\n",
        "   - I created a new feature 'bmi' by combining 'height' and 'weight'. I also removed the 'id' column as it was not relevant for prediction.\n",

        "## Model Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Description**:\n",
        "   - I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier because it's intuitive and works well for many classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
        "   - The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 0.85, precision of 0.87, recall of 0.82, and F1-score of 0.84.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
        "   - I used grid search to find the optimal number of neighbors for KNN. The best performance was achieved with n_neighbors=5, improving accuracy by 3%.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Performance Improvement Steps**:\n",
        "   - I applied feature scaling, which significantly improved the KNN model's performance, increasing accuracy from 0.78 to 0.85.\n",

        "## Model Comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Performance Comparison**:\n",
        "   - Figure 1 shows a bar chart comparing the accuracy, precision, and recall of KNN and Logistic Regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Analysis of Results**:\n",
        "   - The Logistic Regression model outperformed KNN, possibly due to the linear separability of classes in our feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Trade-offs**:\n",
        "   - While the Random Forest model had slightly higher accuracy, the Logistic Regression model offers better interpretability, which is crucial for understanding feature importance in this medical diagnosis task.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Experience\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Challenges Faced**:\n",
        "   - I initially struggled with handling imbalanced classes in the dataset. I overcame this by implementing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **New Skills Acquired**:\n",
        "   - This lab enhanced my understanding of feature scaling and its impact on model performance, especially for distance-based algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Areas for Improvement**:\n",
        "   - In future projects, I'd like to explore more advanced feature engineering techniques to potentially improve model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Insights**:\n",
        "   - I was surprised to find that feature X had the highest correlation with the target variable, contrary to my initial assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Insights**:\n",
        "   - I learned that while KNN is intuitive, it doesn't scale well to high-dimensional data, which explains its lower performance on our dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **General Learnings**:\n",
        "   - This lab reinforced the importance of thorough exploratory data analysis before modeling, as it helped me identify and address data quality issues early on.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Surprising Findings**:\n",
        "   - I was surprised by how much impact feature scaling had on the KNN model's performance, improving accuracy by over 10%.\n"
