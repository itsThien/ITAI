# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and projects related to data science and machine learning. The projects cover various topics, including data cleaning, supervised learning, deep learning, and a comparison of popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Notebooks

- **`CineSenti_Exploring_Movie_Sentiment_with_Word2Vec,_TF_IDF_&_FastText.ipynb`**: This notebook explores movie sentiment analysis using various natural language processing techniques, including Word2Vec, TF-IDF, and FastText, on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset.

- **`Cleaning_Data.ipynb`**: This notebook demonstrates various data cleaning and preprocessing techniques on the `Customer Call List.xlsx` dataset. It includes steps like removing duplicates, standardizing columns, and filtering data.

- **`Data Preprocessing Lab.ipynb`**: A lab focused on data preprocessing techniques using the `bbc-news-data.csv` dataset.

- **`Real_world_Application_of_Supervised_Learning.ipynb`**: This notebook showcases a real-world application of supervised learning by comparing the performance of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers on a wine quality dataset.

- **`Supervised_Learning_Exploration.ipynb`**: A notebook designed as a learning exercise to explore supervised learning concepts. It uses the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn to implement and evaluate K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression models.

- **`TensorFlow and Keras.ipynb`**: An introductory lab to deep learning that uses a pre-trained VGG16 model for image classification. It provides an interactive way to understand the deep learning workflow.

- **`TensorFlow vs PyTorch`**: This script compares the training performance of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset using both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Datasets

- **IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews**: Used in the `CineSenti_Exploring_Movie_Sentiment_with_Word2Vec,_TF_IDF_&_FastText.ipynb` notebook. This dataset is downloaded from KaggleHub (`lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews`).
- **`bbc-news-data.csv`**: A dataset containing news articles from the BBC, used in the `Data Preprocessing Lab.ipynb`.
- **`Customer Call List.xlsx`**: An Excel file containing customer data used in the `Cleaning_Data.ipynb` notebook.
- **Wine Quality Dataset**: Used in the `Real_world_Application_of_Supervised_Learning.ipynb` notebook, this dataset is loaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: This dataset from scikit-learn is used in the `Supervised_Learning_Exploration.ipynb` notebook.
- **MNIST Dataset**: The `TensorFlow vs PyTorch` script uses the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
